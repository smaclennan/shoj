    <h1>Welcome to SAM's House of Jiras</h1>

    <p>You are probably here because you joined coreos... congrats!

    <p>What is SHOJ? It started as
    an <a href="email.html">email</a>. Then, when we started using
    MatterMost a lot, I made it a channel.

    <p>If you like consistency, you will not like SHOJ. SHOJ is both
    omnipotent and dysfunctional. We mainly sell weird items, think
    Ronco or K-Tel. But we also have a tech company (Quasitech), a
    bank, and dabble in foreign affairs. We are known by all the global
    leaders, who call upon us for help sometimes; like security at the
    Queen's Funeral, or overthrowing a government.

    <p>But SHOJ is also continuously broke. Every time we make money,
    we blow it on something stupid. Think Jeff Foxworthy redneck, not
    real redneck. We are always looking for money for another case of
    beer.

    <p>So, feel free to post. You can claim SHOJ is involved in almost
      anything.

    <p>If you feel that SHOJ is too silly, feel free to leave the
      channel. I realize it is not for everybody and will not be
      offended.

      <h2>Q & A</h2>

    <p>Q: Why is the website so ugly?<br>
      A: Thank you. We are trying to go for a geocities look, just
      without the glaring colours and minimal animated gifs. We, of
      course, have the obligatory "Under Construction". And it is Marc
      Perron approved.

    <p>Q: What is up with the ISO9001 image?<br>
      A: SHOJ has declared itself self-certifying in *all*
      standards. This is SHOJ ISO9001 certificate. No standards body
      is willing to go up against SHOJ.

    <p>Q: Why are the operators sitting by?<br>
      A: Because we care about our operators! Here is the original
      quote:<br>"Order yours today! Operators are standing
      by... well, actually they are sitting. Why would they stand all
      day to answer the phone?"

    <p>Q: Why all the talk about mauls?<br>
      A: That is really not associated with SHOJ, but I will still
      answer. I can't remember when I recommended the maul to answer an
      MM question. I wanted a very blunt instrument, but a
      sledgehammer was too obvious. So I went with maul... and it went
      viral (on QNX MM at least).
